Check whether or not it\n   's a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that's read the same both ways.\n  \n    For example:\n    >>> is_palindrome(\"lol\")\n    True\n    >>> is_palindrome(\"hi\")\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    if S[::-1] == S:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n\ndef is_prime(N):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a number N. For this mission, let's call a number prime\n    if it has exactly two distinct divisors: 1 and N itself.\n  \n    For example:\n    >>> is_prime(2)\n    True\n    >>> is_prime(15)\n    False\n    \"\"\"\n    # Your code here\n    divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        if N % i == 0:\n            divisors += 1\n\n    if divisors =="
